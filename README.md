Command       |   Effect

`cd <file path>`| Takes you to that filepath on the same drive
`/D <file path>`| Takes you to the filepath on a different drive (Windows command)
`dir`           | Shows directories within current folder (Windows command)
`ls`            | Shows directories within current folder on Linux and Mac platforms

Once the startup animation is complete, you'll be shown to the login page.

Click on the button that says "Sign me up!" to open the account creation page. Enter your information, check that your username is available, and click "Sign up" to go to the main menu

From here you can choose any of the three surveys to fill out regarding your stay!
